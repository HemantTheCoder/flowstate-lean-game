# 🏗️ FlowState: Mastering Lean Construction

**FlowState** is a narrative-driven, educational simulation game designed to teach the principles of Lean Construction and high-performance project management. Players step into the shoes of a Project Architect, transforming chaotic construction sites into efficient, flow-centric environments.

> [!NOTE]
> **Project Status Update**: February 18, 2026
> The core engine is fully stable, and Chapter 1 & 2 foundations are complete.

## 🎮 The Experience

FlowState blends a visual novel narrative with deep management simulation. As you navigate through different chapters, you'll work with characters like **Mira** (Project Lead) and **Rao** (Smart Advisor) to implement lean strategies.

### Core Gameplay Mechanics

*   **Interactive Construction Site**: Real-time visualization of work trailers and labor movement powered by a custom Phaser engine.
*   **Dynamic Kanban System**: Manage task flow from Backlog to Done. Set Work-In-Progress (WIP) limits and watch as your field crews respond to your management decisions.
*   **The Planning Room (Chapter 2)**: A deep dive into the **Last Planner System (LPS)**. Use the 3-panel planning interface to manage:
    *   **Master Plan**: The long-term project vision.
    *   **Lookahead Planning**: Identifying and removing constraints before they hit the field.
    *   **Weekly Work Plan**: Committing to tasks and tracking success.

### Advanced Analytics
Track your management performance with industry-standard Lean metrics:
*   **PPC (Percent Plan Complete)**: Measure your planning reliability.
*   **LPI (Lean Performance Index)**: A composite score based on flow efficiency and waste reduction.
*   **WIP Compliance**: Monitor how well you respect the system's capacity.
