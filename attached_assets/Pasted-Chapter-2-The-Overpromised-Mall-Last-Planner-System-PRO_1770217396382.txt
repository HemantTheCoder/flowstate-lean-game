Chapter 2: The Overpromised Mall (Last Planner System)
PROJECT CONTEXT

Build Chapter 2 of a web-based, anime-style, story-driven Lean construction game called:

FLOWSTATE: Saga of the Flow Architect.

Chapter 1 (Kanban) is already implemented.

Chapter 2 must teach Last Planner System (LPS) using a five-day interactive week (Week 2 in-game).

Target learners: Civil engineering students and construction professionals.

Learning must occur through:

Narrative

Daily decisions

Visual cause-and-effect

Emotional character reactions

Performance metrics (PPC)

Avoid textbook explanations. Concepts emerge from gameplay.

CHAPTER 2 OVERVIEW

Location: Riverside Market Mall redevelopment.

Visual tone:

Bright anime city

Half-built food stalls

Cranes, scaffolding

Warm pastel palette

Expressive NPC portraits

Theme:
Reliable commitments vs optimistic schedules.

Core learning goals:

Lookahead planning

Constraint identification

Constraint removal

Weekly commitments

Overcommitment consequences

PPC (Percent Plan Complete)

Human impact of broken promises

Chapter structure:

Intro Story
→ Planning Day (Day 0)
→ Day 1
→ Day 2
→ Day 3
→ Day 4
→ Day 5 Inspection
→ PPC + Debrief
→ Chapter 3 Unlock

INTRO CUTSCENE

Client NPC:

“Last week your flow improved. This time I need dates.”

Isha:

“I already prepared the schedule.”

Mira:

“A schedule is not a promise.”

Old Foreman:

“Promises break faster than concrete.”

Overlay:

CHAPTER 2 — THE OVERPROMISED MALL
LAST PLANNER SYSTEM

Learning goals appear:

This chapter teaches:
• Making reliable weekly commitments
• Removing constraints before promising
• Avoiding overcommitment
• Using PPC to measure trust

Button: BEGIN PLANNING

DAY 0 — PLANNING DAY (Last Planner Setup)

Player enters Planning Room.

PLANNING ROOM UI

Desktop layout:

LEFT PANEL — Master Plan (all tasks, read-only)
CENTER PANEL — Lookahead Board (task cards with constraint icons)
RIGHT PANEL — Task Inspector (task details + actions)
BOTTOM — Weekly Work Plan slots (4–6)
BOTTOM BAR — Budget, Morale
CENTER BOTTOM — START DAY 1

Task colors:
Red = blocked
Yellow = risky
Green = ready

Only GREEN tasks can be committed without penalty.

Yellow/Red tasks can be forced but become fragile.

SPOTLIGHT TUTORIAL SYSTEM (Day 0)

Guided overlays:

Lookahead Board
Mira: “These are upcoming tasks. Not all are ready.”

Constraint Icons
Old Foreman: “Red blocked. Yellow risky. Green ready. No green — no promise.”

Task Inspector
Isha: “Every task hides reasons it might fail.”

Constraint Removal Buttons
Mira: “Last Planner means making work ready.”

Player must remove at least one constraint.

Buttons:

Call Supplier

Reassign Crew

Request Approval

Resequence

Each has visual effects and resource cost.

Weekly Work Plan
Old Foreman: “This is your promise board.”

START DAY 1
Tooltip: “Once Day 1 starts, promises are locked.”

TASK MODEL

Each task:

id
name
duration
constraints {material, crew, approval, weather}
promised
completed
fragile

Fragile tasks have +30% failure probability.

DAILY GAMEPLAY FLOW (Day 1–Day 5)

Each day consists of:

Morning briefing (story)
→ Site interaction
→ Player choices
→ Visual consequences
→ End-of-day summary

DAY 1 — Commitments

Toolbox meeting.

Isha:

“These are today’s promises.”

Player assigns crews to promised tasks.

Learning:
Difference between planned and promised.

DAY 2 — Constraints

Event:
Material delay or missing approval.

Player chooses:

Call supplier

Resequence

Ignore

Ignoring stalls tasks.

Mira:

“This is why we clear constraints first.”

DAY 3 — Client Pressure

Client:

“Can you also finish café roofing?”

Choice:
Accept / Decline.

Accept adds unplanned work and increases PPC denominator.

Learning:
Overcommitment.

DAY 4 — Recovery or Collapse

Based on previous choices:

Either:
Smooth flow
OR
Multiple stalled tasks + defects

Player may:

Reassign crews

Drop low-priority task

Do nothing

Learning:
Preparation vs firefighting.

DAY 5 — Inspection

Inspector NPC arrives.

Counts:

Promised tasks

Completed tasks

Defects

Then PPC displayed:

PPC = Completed Promised / Total Promised × 100

Animated gauge.

Characters react emotionally.

PPC EFFECTS

80%:
Morale +10
Trust +15

50–80%:
Neutral

<50%:
Morale −10
Trust −15

FINAL DEBRIEF

Show:

PPC %

Failed promises

Unplanned work

Constraint misses

Narrative summary:

“You promised X tasks and completed Y.

Failures came from:
• Hidden constraints
• Overcommitment
• Unplanned work

Last Planner teaches:
Remove constraints before committing.
Promise only what can be done.”

Award badges:
Promise Keeper
Constraint Crusher
Reliable Planner

CHAPTER END

VN scene.

Mall partially opens.

Old Foreman:

“Now promises are honest. Next we clean the mess.”

CHAPTER 3 UNLOCKED — THE TANGLED DEPOT (5S)

EDUCATIONAL OUTCOME

Player must internalize:

Planning ≠ Promising
Constraints cause failure
PPC measures reliability
Overcommitment destroys trust

Especially framed for civil engineers.
