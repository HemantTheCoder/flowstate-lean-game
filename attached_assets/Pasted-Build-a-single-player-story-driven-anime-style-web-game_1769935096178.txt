Build a single-player, story-driven, anime-style web game called:

FLOWSTATE: Saga of the Flow Architect

This is an interactive Lean-learning management game that teaches Lean concepts (Kanban, Last Planner System, 5S, Pull System, Waste/MUDA) through gameplay, storytelling, visual feedback, and player choices — not lectures.

The game must feel like a real indie game: fun, emotional, visually appealing, and interactive.

Target platform: Web (HTML/CSS/JS or framework-based)
Camera: Isometric or top-down 2.5D
Art style: Anime / soft pastel / cozy indie management game

CORE PREMISE

The player becomes a “Flow Architect” hired to fix broken projects in a struggling city called Flowstate.

Projects are chaotic:

People are busy but nothing finishes

Materials pile up

Workers walk endlessly

Deadlines are missed

The player restores flow using Lean tools.

Learning happens by seeing cause → effect, not reading theory.

CORE GAME LOOP

Story introduction (visual novel style dialogue)

Player enters project site

Player observes chaos visually

Player chooses Lean actions

One in-game “week” simulates

Results appear visually + via metrics

Characters react emotionally

Player reflects and continues

Repeat per chapter.

VISUAL STYLE

Anime-inspired characters (portrait dialogue boxes)

Isometric construction/factory sites

Cute workers walking around

Floating Kanban cards

Soft shadows

Rounded UI

Pastel color palette

Smooth animations

Use:

Subtle background music

Soft click sounds

“Flow” whoosh sound when systems improve

Congestion sounds when overloaded

Tone: calming, thoughtful, satisfying.

CHARACTERS

Include at least:

Mira (Site Engineer – overworked but smart)

Rao (Contractor – pushes work aggressively)

Isha (Planner – plans too much)

Old Foreman (traditional mindset)

They speak via dialogue boxes and react dynamically to player decisions.

They have emotional states:

Morale

Stress

Trust

These change based on gameplay.

GAMEPLAY SYSTEMS (LEAN AS MECHANICS)
1. Kanban System (Core)

Display an animated Kanban board:

Columns:

Backlog

Ready

In Progress

Review

Done

Each column has adjustable WIP limits.

Gameplay:

Tasks are cards.

Workers pull cards only if WIP allows.

Exceeding WIP creates visual congestion (queues, slow movement).

Balanced WIP creates smooth flow.

Player directly sets WIP limits.

2. Last Planner System (Weekly Planning)

Once per in-game week:

Player enters planning room scene.

Tasks show constraint icons:

Material missing

Crew unavailable

Approval pending

Weather risk

Player must remove constraints BEFORE committing.

Then player selects tasks to promise.

Calculate:
PPC (Percent Plan Complete)

Display PPC as progress bar + character reactions.

3. 5S Mini-Game

Player performs site organization:

Drag tools to racks

Label areas

Create walking paths

Clean clutter

Before/after visuals.

Rewards:

Faster workers

Reduced errors

Brighter site visuals

4. Pull System

Downstream teams send glowing pull signals.

Upstream teams cannot work unless pulled.

If player pushes work manually:

Inventory piles appear

Waste gremlins spawn

Space shrinks

Pull creates smooth animation lines.

5. Waste (MUDA)

Seven wastes represented as little shadow gremlins/clouds:

Waiting

Motion

Inventory

Overproduction

Transportation

Defects

Overprocessing

Hovering gives hint.

Applying correct Lean tool removes them with satisfying animation.

PEOPLE SYSTEM

Every action affects:

Productivity

Morale

Stress

Trust

Example:
Pushing work = short-term speed, long-term morale loss + defects.

Characters visibly react.

SCORING

Create Lean Performance Index (LPI):

Combine:

Flow efficiency

PPC

WIP compliance

Waste removed

Inventory level

Team morale

Player does NOT win by speed.
Player wins by stability and flow.

CHAPTER PROGRESSION

At least 5 chapters:

Welcome to Flowstate (Kanban basics)

The Overpromised Mall (Last Planner + PPC)

Tangled Depot (5S)

Assembly Alley (Pull System)

Grand Transit (all systems combined)

Each chapter:

New constraints

New story

Harder decisions

Multiple endings per chapter.

DEBRIEF SCREEN

After each chapter show:

Before vs After site image

Lean Performance Index

Short explanation (simple language) mapping player actions → Lean concepts

Character quotes

Unlock badges:

Kanban Master

5S Champion

Pull Strategist

Flow Architect

Keep explanations under ~120 words.

UI REQUIREMENTS

Friendly rounded panels

Minimal jargon

Tooltips appear as character dialogue

Undo / retry allowed

Save & continue

MULTIPLAYER

Do NOT implement now.

Add Home Screen button:

“Multiplayer — Coming Soon”

TECH EXPECTATIONS

Web-based game.

Prefer:

Canvas or game engine rendering

Modular JS

Simple backend optional (local save)

Include:

Save/load

Audio toggle

Performance metrics panel

EDUCATIONAL GOAL

Feeling flow vs congestion

Seeing visual cause-effect

Making choices

Observing consequences

Reflecting via debrief

No textbook explanations.

FINAL REQUIREMENTS

Must feel like a real game, not corporate training

Anime-ish visuals

Story-driven
