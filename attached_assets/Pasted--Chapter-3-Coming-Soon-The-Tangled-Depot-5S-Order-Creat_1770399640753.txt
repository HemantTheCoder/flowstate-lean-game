After improving flow (Kanban) and making reliable promises (Last Planner), you arrive at the mall’s material depot.

Tools are scattered. Walk paths are blocked. Materials are stacked randomly. Workers spend more time searching than building.

Your next challenge is to transform a cluttered depot into an organized, efficient work environment.
