Chapter 2: The Overpromised Mall (Last Planner System)
CONTEXT

This is Chapter 2 of a web-based, anime-style, story-driven Lean construction game called:

FLOWSTATE: Saga of the Flow Architect

Chapter 1 (Kanban) is already implemented.

Chapter 2 must teach Last Planner System (LPS) using a five-day interactive week (Week 2 in-game).

Target learners: Civil engineering students and construction professionals.

Learning must be experiential:

Narrative

Visual cause–effect

Daily decisions

Emotional character reactions

PPC performance feedback

Avoid textbook explanations.

Core concepts:

Lookahead planning

Constraint identification

Constraint removal

Weekly commitments

Overcommitment

PPC (Percent Plan Complete)

Reliability vs optimism

CHAPTER FLOW

Intro Story
→ Day 1 Planning + Tutorial
→ Day 1 Execution
→ Day 2 Site Issue
→ Day 3 Client Pressure
→ Day 4 Recovery / Collapse
→ Day 5 Inspection + PPC
→ Debrief
→ Chapter 3 Teaser

INTRO CUTSCENE

Riverside Market Mall under construction.

Client:

“Last week your flow improved. This time I need dates.”

Isha:

“I already prepared the schedule.”

Mira:

“A schedule is not a promise.”

Old Foreman:

“Promises break faster than concrete.”

CHAPTER 2 — THE OVERPROMISED MALL
LAST PLANNER SYSTEM

Overlay:

🎯 You will learn:
• How to make reliable commitments
• How to remove constraints before promising
• Why overcommitment fails
• How PPC measures trust

Button:
BEGIN DAY 1 PLANNING

DAY 1 — PLANNING DAY (MAIN TUTORIAL)

Player enters Planning Room.

PLANNING ROOM UI

LEFT: Master Plan (all tasks, read-only)
CENTER: Lookahead Board (tasks with constraint icons)
RIGHT: Task Inspector
BOTTOM: Weekly Commitment Slots (4–6)
BOTTOM BAR: Budget | Morale
CENTER BOTTOM: START DAY 1

Task colors:
Red = blocked
Yellow = risky
Green = ready

Only GREEN tasks are safe to commit.

Yellow tasks may be forced but become fragile.

SPOTLIGHT TUTORIAL

Step 1 — Lookahead
Mira:
“These are upcoming tasks. Not all are ready.”

Player clicks task.

Step 2 — Constraints
Old Foreman:
“Red blocked. Yellow risky. Green ready. No green — no promise.”

Player hovers icons.

Step 3 — Task Inspector
Isha:
“Every task hides reasons it might fail.”

Step 4 — Constraint Removal Buttons
Buttons:
Call Supplier
Reassign Crew
Request Approval
Resequence

Mira:
“Last Planner means making work ready.”

Player removes at least one constraint.

Step 5 — Weekly Commitment
Old Foreman:
“This is your promise board.”

Player drags GREEN tasks.

Yellow drag shows warning.

Step 6 — Start Day 1
Tooltip:
“Once Day 1 starts, promises are locked.”

Player clicks START DAY 1.

TASK MODEL

Each task:

id
name
duration
constraints {material, crew, approval, weather}
promised
completed
fragile

Fragile tasks have +30% failure probability.

DAY 1 — EXECUTION

Site view appears.

Crews begin promised tasks.

User assigns crews via simple drag.

No failures yet.

End-of-day:

“All promised tasks started.”

DAY 2 — CONSTRAINTS

Popup:

Material delayed OR approval missing.

One promised task stalls.

User chooses:

Call supplier

Resequence

Ignore

Immediate visual effect.

Learning:
Hidden constraints break promises.

DAY 3 — CLIENT PRESSURE

Client:

“Can you also finish café roofing?”

Choice:
Accept / Decline

Accept adds unplanned task and increases PPC denominator.

Learning:
Overcommitment.

DAY 4 — RECOVERY OR COLLAPSE

Based on prior choices:

Either smooth flow
Or stalled tasks + defects + morale drop.

User may:

Reassign crews

Drop low priority task

Do nothing

Learning:
Preparation vs firefighting.

DAY 5 — INSPECTION + PPC

Inspector arrives.

Counts:
Promised tasks
Completed tasks
Defects

PPC shown:

PPC = Completed Promised / Total Promised × 100

Animated gauge.

Character reactions.

PPC EFFECTS

80%:
Morale +10
Trust +15

50–80%:
Neutral

<50%:
Morale −10
Trust −15

FINAL DEBRIEF

Show:

PPC %

Failed promises

Unplanned work

Constraint misses

Narrative:

“You promised X tasks and completed Y.

Failures came from:
• Hidden constraints
• Overcommitment
• Unplanned work

Last Planner teaches:
Remove constraints before committing.
Promise only what can be done.”

Badges:
Promise Keeper
Constraint Crusher
Reliable Planner

CHAPTER END

Mall partially opens.

Old Foreman:

“Now promises are honest. Next we clean the mess.”

EDUCATIONAL OUTCOME

Player must internalize:

Planning ≠ Promising
Constraints cause failure
PPC measures reliability
Overcommitment destroys trust

Framed for civil engineers.
