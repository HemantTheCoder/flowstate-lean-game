⭐ 1. Animated Kanban + WIP Slider (CORE)

This is non-negotiable.

You already have Kanban — now add:

Add:

WIP slider on “In Progress”

Cards visibly queue if WIP exceeded

Workers slow down

Small congestion clouds appear

Player learns:

Less work in progress = faster completion

⭐ 2. Push vs Pull Decision Moment

Once per chapter:

Rao asks to push.

Popup:

Rao: "Let’s start painting too."

[ Push Work ]
[ Wait for Pull ]


Push creates inventory + delays.

Pull creates smooth animation.

Player learns:

Push causes waste.

⭐ 3. Bottleneck Heatspot (Visual)

Show pulsing red hotspot where work accumulates.

Clicking shows:

Waiting time

Which tasks are causing it

This is HUGE for engineering thinking.

⭐ 4. Daily Mini Decisions (2–3 total)

Instead of passive watching:

Let player:

Adjust WIP

Respond to push request

Reassign crew once

Tiny choices → big visual effects.

Keeps engagement high.

⭐ 5. Waste Gremlins (Simple Visual Metaphor)

Tiny shadows over:

Inventory piles

Waiting workers

When player fixes issue → sparkle + sound.

Low effort, high clarity.

⭐ 6. End-of-Chapter Visual Performance Summary (VERY IMPORTANT)

This is what you mentioned — and yes, this is essential.

Let’s design it properly.

🎨 End-of-Chapter Visual Summary (Kanban)

This appears after Day 5.

This is NOT just numbers.

It is VISUAL.
